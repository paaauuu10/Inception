#FastCGI is a protocol that allows web servers (such as NGINX or Apache) to efficiently communicate with external applications, 
#especially PHP-FPM in the case of PHP.
#Instead of starting a new PHP process for each request (which would be slow), 
#FastCGI keeps PHP processes running and reuses connections, improving performance.
